# home-loan-default-prediction

This will be the home of a project that tells the story of [Austin home mortgages]. 

The main corpus of data is 500,000 home loan documents (“_Deeds of Trust_”) since 2005 and 25,000 foreclosures (“_Notices of Substitute Trustee Sale_”) since 2010, web scraped from the Travis County public records website. 

This info will be combined with tax assessment, census, tax delinquencies and property prices data from separate databases in order to form a complete set of publicly available features, aiming to find reliable predictors of home loan defaults.
